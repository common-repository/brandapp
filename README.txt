With our Wordpress plugin you are able to open **[BrandApp](https://brandapp.io/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)** directly within the Media Library as you normally import and add media (image and video etc.) to your posts, pages and featured images. 
Since you probably quite often work inside Wordpress Admin, we've placed a handy shortcut to BrandApp on the left navigation menu as well.

The team behind BrandApp truly believe that everyone that is running a business is capable of doing most of their visual marketing with a bit of help. 
An all-inclusive marketing tool that is both cheap and easy to use, which also contain a lot of simple tips and guides along the way, is what we think is needed.

**Cheap design tool**  - If you were to buy or subscribe to equivalent services and features, you would pay a lot, and they are often over complicated for your use. 

**Design Consistency** - Building a brand involves a visual profile, but more importantly is to stick to it! We provide tools to be creative within that profile.

**Online with backup** - Having access to your brand assets, designs and marketing in the cloud is essential today, as well as easy recovery of all this.

**No installation** - Modern tools and files shouldn't stay on a local machine. It should be accessible everywhere, to everyone, at any time.

**Always updated** - Whenever we launch new features, improve the user interface or fix bugs, BrandApp will always be updated to the latest version.

**Share access** - Let your whole team take part of building a great brand, and you can even let designers help out be giving them access. 

BrandApp is an brand oriented design tool for small and medium sized businesses. It's an alternative to online services like Canva, 
Shutterstock Editor, Fotojet, PicMonkey, Crello, Snappa, or even professional design products like Photoshop, Figma, Sketch. 

Although there are many great tools out there, we always see people struggle with the complexity of these. These tools also have a tendency to lead your brand design away from the design consistency (your colors, fonts, and setup), by providing lots and lots of templates. Great for inspiration - not great for your brand recognition. 

= Use of a 3rd Party or external service =
